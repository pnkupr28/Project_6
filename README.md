# Project 6 Classification

### Name

_Patrick_

### Introspection

_The main challenge was being able to make sure I had everything properly added and imported. It was easy to overlook small details, like missing libraries or forgetting to download necessary resources such as stopword lists or lemmatization packages. Even with careful planning, I occasionally encountered errors because of a missing or incorrect import, which would disrupt the entire workflow. Ensuring all dependencies were in place, from nltk downloads to sklearn modules, required extra attention to detail and a systematic approach to troubleshooting. This process taught me the importance of double-checking my environment setup and dependencies before running the code_

### Dataset

The dataset that I choose for the classification task was "SMSSpam"_

### Resources

_I just had Vishnu make sure everything I did was correct and proper_

## Goal

The goals of this project are:

* Using built-in and core Python libraries to develop a classification model for an unseen dataset
* Understand the steps for a machine learning task
* Learn to read documentation to understand what each object and method does and other helpful methods available.

## Description

In this project, you are provided with a Jupyter Notebook that contains code to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiment of IMDB review dataset. Your goal is to use this notebook as an example and create a similar notebook to train a classifier on a similar dataset, but **not the IMDB dataset**. These dataset files are provided in the dataset folder.

In this project there are two primary tasks:

1. Create a Jupyter notebook that performs all the steps described in the example notebook on a different dataset.
2. Understand the libraries, classes, and methods being used by reading the documentation and answer the prompt questions.

It should be fairly easy to duplicate the example notebook and train a ML model on a different dataset, however, without understanding what is happening you won't be able to use it on a different problem. Answer each question in as much detail as possible.

## Tips On How To Excel


* Start early!
* Ask for help when stuck. Remember the 30 minute rule? No? Look into the syllabus.
* Break down the problem into smaller tasks and try to implement them in Jupyter Notebook. Once implemented in the notebook successfully, transfer it into `.py` file.
* Run the `.py` file to make sure the new addition did not break any changes.
* After implementing each small task, commit changes.
* Review the notebooks from classes available on GitHub if you cannot remember syntax for anything.
* Run your code multiple times and vary the inputs to ensure it works as intended.
